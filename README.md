The Team Profile Generator runs an index.js app that presents the user with quetions that allow them to enter a manager, along with multiple engineers and interns. When the user is finished building his or her team, an HTML file is generated that displays their team.

When the user clicks on the email or GitHub links, they are taken to those respective pages.
